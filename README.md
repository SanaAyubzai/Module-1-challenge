# Module 1 challenge
 
THe MOST CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGNS are run for "film & video" (n=178), "music" (n=175), and "theater" (n=344) AND the categories with the highest NUMBER of SUCCESSFUL campaigns were "film & video" (n=102), "music" (n=99), and "theater" (n=187).
The categroies with the highest PERCENTAGE of SUCCESSFUL campaigns were "journalism" (100%), "technology" (67%) and "photography" (62%).
The subcategories with the highest PERCENTAGE of CANCELED campaigns were "television" (18%), "photography books" (10%), and "food trucks" (9%).
The WORST MONTHS to start a campaign are AUGUST, DECEMBER and JANUARY. The percentages of canceled and failed campaigns are higher in these months than the average for all months and the percentage of successful campaignsis are lower in these months than the average for all months.
The BEST month to start a campaign is JULY. July had the highest TOTAL number of campaigns per month (93), highest number of SUCCESFUL campaigns per month (58) and second highes percentage of successful campaings per month (63%, highest was 64%), and realtively low percentage of failed campaings (33%, lowest was 32%)
THe campaigns with a goals of "Greater than or equal to $50,000" or between "$10,000 and $14,999" were the least likely to succeed (37% and 44%), most likely to fail (53% and 56%) and most likely to be canceled (9% for the >=50000 group).
What are some limitations of this dataset? Some campaigns could fit more than one classification. For example journalism/audio might also be considered publishing/radio & podcasts.
2020 has much less data than the other years, 2 campaigns compared to aorund 85 to 110 for other years. The table does not include a currency conversion to display currencies from all countries in an equivilant way. Donatio.ns and goals in DKK, USD and GBP are just comparing raw numbers

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide? Percentage of successful and failed campaigns by duration of campaign (deadline - launched dates). This could show the optimal duration to keep a campaign open. Average donation compared to month campaign started. This could show correlation of donation level to the time of year a campaign is started to provide insight into start dates for future campaigns.

Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data. THe distribution for our data sets is negatively skewed. For both the successful and failed campaigns, the MEDIAN better summarizes these data because most of the campagins had a numebr of backers that were less than the average.

Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not? There is more variability with the successful campaigns. SUccessful campaigns have both a higher SD and variance. THis makes sense since one would assume that more of the failed campaigns brought in fewer total funds by a smaller number of backers.
However the number of backers for some failed camapigns is higher than the total for some successful campagins. I think that you can not look at the # of backers alone, but need to look at the number of backers together with the total goal of the campaign.

Note on the Outcome by Goal tab: Written instructions described last goal as "greater than or equal to 50000" however sample chart showed "greater than 50000." I chose to use "greater than or equal to 50000" as it provides continuity in the categories else a value of exactly 50000 could never be reported upon.
